# Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
This page can be useful if you are trying to automate something or if you are trying to retrieve data programmatically.

## ASN Authentication Solution
Authenticate your users by having them verify their ASN ownership with KIOUBIT-MNT using their registry-provided methods in an automated way.
More Information in the setup tutorial: https://dn42.g-load.eu/auth/documentation/tutorial.html
To use the service, please message Kioubit on IRC to have your domain activated.

## Registry REST API

[dn42regsrv](https://git.dn42.us/burble/dn42regsrv) is a REST API for the DN42 registry that provides a bridge between interactive applications and the registry.

As well as the main REST API to the DN42 registry, the server can also generate ROA tables and provides a small web application for exploring registry data.

A public instance of the API and associated explorer web app is available at the following URLs:
