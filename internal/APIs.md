##Proving ASN ownership
Through this automated service you prove your ASN ownership to KIOUBIT-MNT who then automatically creates a "ownership verification signature". This signature can be very easily verified by anyone. This removes the hassle from checking every different authentication method in the registry. This is particularly useful for automated setups.
