# Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
This page can be useful if you are trying to automate something or if you are trying to retrieve data programmatically.

### ASN Authentication Solution
Authenticate your users by having them verify their ASN ownership with KIOUBIT-MNT using their registry-provided methods in an automated way. An example of this is the automatic peering system for the Kioubit Network.

## Registry REST API

[dn42regsrv](https://git.burble.com/burble.dn42/dn42regsrv) is a REST API for the DN42 registry that provides a bridge between interactive applications and the registry.

As well as the main REST API to the DN42 registry, the server can also generate ROA tables and provides a small web application for exploring registry data.

A public instance of the API and associated explorer web app is available at the following URLs:
