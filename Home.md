Welcome to the dn42 wiki :-)

If you are here you probably already joined dn42, so instead of talking
about dn42 we should just put useful services here :-)

The git URL to access this wiki is git://git1.wiki.dn42/.  The anonymous
push doesn't seem to be working remotely (nobody found out).  I think
it is fixed.  Can someone please confirm?

A (for now) read-only mirror that is updated hourly exists at
[[http://wiki.neoraider.dn42/]]. That one should be accessible
from all IP ranges announced over BGP, including Freifunk's 10/8 ranges.
If NeoRaider accidentially filters your range, just drop him a message via IRC.
