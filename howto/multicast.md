## Multicast

RFC 8815 deprecated PIM-SM so PIM-SSM is the way to go!

### Setup

For it to work, you'll need to do the following:
  * Ask your peering to enable ipv4/ipv6 multicast AFI on your peering
  * Set up IPv4/IPv6 PIM for the (s,g) joins to pass through
  * Be prepared to setup IGMP v3 and MLD v2 from your listeners

You're done! You should receive the multicast routes from peers advertising them.

[FRR configuration](https://git.lemonsh.moe/C4TG1RL5/dn42/src/branch/master/lab.rtr.famfo.catgirls.dn42/frr) used by C4TG1RL5.
_Please make sure you understand how to configure and use frr before you use anything from this configuration!_
