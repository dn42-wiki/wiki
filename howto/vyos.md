#VyOS
VyOS is an open source router.  The developers have a nightly rolling release that includes all the latest features such as Wireguard.  
  
It can be downloaded here https://www.vyos.io/rolling-release/.  
  

_1.3-rolling-202004300117 is a known good release to work with Wireguard and DN42._


##Quick Start
###Quick to-do-list from router deployment to receiving DN42 routes
1. Establish internet connectivity.
2. Setup Wireguard.
3. Setup BGP.
4. `show ip route`


##Wireguard
###Setup Keys 
`generate wireguard default-keypair`    
`show wireguard keypairs pubkey default`  
_Grab your public key and save it for later.  This will be shared with peers._  
###Configure Peer Tunnel  
Your peer should provide their endpoint public IP, port, single DN42 address, and Wireguard public key.   
   
`set interfaces wireguard wg01 address '172.x.x.x/32'`  
_this is a single address within your DN42 registered address space_  
`set interfaces wireguard wg01 peer OtherGuy1 allowed-ips '0.0.0.0/0''`  
_it's just easier to filter traffic with the firewall_  
`set interfaces wireguard wg01 peer OtherGuy1 address 'x.x.x.x'`  
_this is the public IP of your peers endpoint_  
`set interfaces wireguard wg01 OtherGuy1 port '12345'`  
_the configured port on your peers endpoint_  
`set interfaces wireguard wg01 peer OtherGuy1 pubkey 'XMrlPykaxhdAAiSjhtPlvi30NVkvLQliQuKP7AI7CyI='`  
_your peers public wireguard key_  
`set interfaces wireguard wg01 port '12345'`  
_the port your wireguard endpoint will "listen" on_  
###Set Static Route  
In case you are wondering how you are going to route packets anywhere with a /32, the next command explains it all.  
     
`set protocols static interface-route 172.x.x.x/32 next-hop-interface wg01`  
_this is a single provided address by your peer that is assigned to them in the registry_  
  
While a normal world configuration may allow multiple peers on one Wireguard interface, this configuration will not work correctly if multiple peers are defined on the same interface.

####Coming Soon

Setup BGP

Neighbor Up With Peer via BGP

RPKI/ROA Checking

Firewall Would be a good ideaâ€¦
