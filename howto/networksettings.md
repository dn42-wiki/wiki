The first rule of dn42: Always disable `rp_filter`. 

The second rule of dn42: Always disable `rp_filter`. 

The third rule of dn42: Allow ip forwarding!

No seriously, in case some packets are dropped, first check if your settings are correct.

`rp_filter` also known as reverse path filtering is a security measure. 
When the route to return a packet uses a different interface than it arrived from, the packet is dropped. 
Some attackers will set a wrong return address on their packets. This security measure was created to address when this happens. Core internet routing can however be asymmetric. This means that packets can take different routes on the return path.
That is why `rp_filter` needs to be disabled.

**Note** using sysctl is not persistent. Depending on your linux distribution put it into `/etc/sysctl.conf` or `/etc/sysctl.d`

```sh
sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=0 net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=0
```

Check that its really disabled:
```sh
sysctl -a | grep rp_filter
```

**Note** The max value from `conf/{all,interface}/rp_filter` is used when doing source validation on the `{interface}`. In case you don't want to disable `rp_filter` for the entire system, the correct setup is to set both `net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=0` and `net.ipv4.conf.{interface}.rp_filter=0`, where `{interface}` is your vpn interface.

Also the following options must be set.
```sh
$ sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1 net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1
```

Check that ALL your vpn interfaces allow ip forwarding for ipv6/ipv4.
```sh
$ sysctl -a | grep forwarding
```

## Note on firewalls, conntrack and asymmetric routing

Do not configure iptables/nftables to drop packets with invalid conntrack state in forward chain.

In some cases your router will not see traffic from both sides e.g. requests are sent via different path not including your networks
but responses are fowarded via your network. This will prevent conntrack from assigning any meaningful state information to these packets
and your firewall will drop it if it is configured to drop packets with invalid state.


## Avoiding Issues with Peer Addressing

When configuring BGP peers in dn42, be cautious about using DN42 IP addresses as peer addresses, particularly in the following scenario:
- You are NOT using extended next hop
- You ARE using the same IP for other services

### The Problem
If your peering link goes down (while the interface remains configured), your peer may have a static route for your service IP via the non-functional tunnel interface. This can make your services inaccessible, even if you have other working peers, because:
- The static route typically has higher priority than BGP routes
- Wireguard interfaces don't automatically go down when peers are unreachable
- Traffic might be routed through peers with broken static routes

This is especially likely to occur if your peers are major transit providers within DN42.

### Solutions
To avoid this issue, use one of these approaches:
1. Use extended next hop in BGP configuration
2. Use non-DN42 addresses for BGP peering
3. Use different IPs for services than for peering
4. De-couple services from specific nodes

### Other Non-Trivial Pitfalls
- **MTU issues with anycast services**: Using higher than minimum MTU for anycasted services can cause issues because path MTU discovery doesn't work properly with anycast. Since different anycast points of presence (POPs) may be reached during discovery attempts, the path MTU detection can fail, leading to packet fragmentation or drops.

- **accept_local sysctl settings**: When running anycast services on routers, ensure the accept_local sysctl is enabled. Without this setting, a router might drop transit traffic from other origins that has the anycasted IP as the source address, breaking connectivity through your network for those services.

- **Inadequate source IP filtering**: Services with public internet access require careful source IP filtering. For example, a DNS server in DN42 might receive requests with spoofed source IPs from inside DN42 that appear to come from public internet addresses. Without proper filtering, your server could respond to these spoofed requests, potentially participating in reflection attacks or exposing internal services to the public internet.

Happy Routing!
