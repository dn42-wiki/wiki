# Pingables

Pingable addresses are intended as a test of whether a network can be reached in principle. Furthermore, it is useful if they show an above-average uptime. Therefore it is recommended to operate them via Anycast.
The following is a list of pingable addresses that can be used for testing. If you want to offer a pingable address, feel free to add it here!

| Domain | IPv4 | IPv6 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pingable.burble.dn42 | 172.20.129.5 | fd42:4242:2601:ac05::1 |
| dns.highdef.dn42 | 172.22.108.53 | fd86:bad:11b7:53::2 |
| anycast.bandura.dn42 | 172.22.149.224 | fd04:234e:fc31:: |

Although these addresses are for testing and having fun, please do not overload them with too many ping requests (very many per second).
