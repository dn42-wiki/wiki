# DN42 DNS Architecture

Simple setup for new users:

All I want is to access an .dn42 domain. You can configure:
* a.recursive-servers.dn42. fd42:d42:d42:54::1, 172.20.0.53

Please check [[New DNS]] - for all the details about the current servers.

It is recommened that you setup your own resolver, please check [[dns/Configuration|Configuration]] - DN42 DNS forward configuration for BIND, dnsmasq, Unbound, PowerDNS, etc.

* [[New DNS]] - current architecture
* [[Old Hierarchical DNS]] - deprecated
* [[Original DNS (deprecated)]] - deprecated
* [[dns/External-DNS|External-DNS]] - external DNS zones from interconnected networks
