# DN42 DNS Architecture

Simple setup for new users:

All I want is to access an .dn42 / .hack / freifunk domain. You can configure the following DNS servers:
* **fd42:d42:d42:54::1 , 172.20.0.53** (a.recursive-servers.dn42)

It is recommended that you setup your own DNS resolver, please check [[dns/Configuration|Configuration]] - DN42 DNS forward configuration for BIND, dnsmasq, Unbound, PowerDNS, etc.

Please check [[New DNS]] - for details about the current DNS system architecture

* [[New DNS]] - current architecture
* [[dns/External-DNS|External-DNS]] - external DNS zones from interconnected networks
* [[Old Hierarchical DNS]] - deprecated
* [[Original DNS (deprecated)]] - deprecated
