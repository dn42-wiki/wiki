# Battlenet Server

bnetd is a software package that was reverse engineered from Blizzard Entertainment's Battle.net online multiplayer gaming service, providing near-complete emulation. The software allows users to create and play games on their own servers, instead of Battle.net servers. Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, bnetd is free software. See this link for client configuration.
CD key non-interoperability

Blizzard games are packaged with unique codes. CD keys are entered, but not verified, during the installation process.
Connection to battle.net is permitted only with a valid and unique key. Individual keys are regularly disabled by battle.net administrators to block suspected cheaters from battle.net. Players with invalid or disabled keys remain able to play independently of battle.net, such as in single-player mode, or through a direct connection to another player.
Blizzard, citing security and piracy concerns on their webpage about emulation, does not allow battle.net to interoperate with bnetd servers to verify CD keys. Because of this, bnetd servers do not implement battle.net's validation. This allows players to access full multiplayer functionality of Battle.net capable games without a valid CD key, by connecting to a bnetd server.
