# About dn42

dn42 is the reboot of  DIAC24. We are a big dynamic VPN with Internet services as  BGP,  OSPF,  DNS, etc. We put emphasis on self-organization and sort the information here in this Wiki. Each participant has a direct connection to at least on other (via  GRE,  OpenVPN, see Tunnelprotocols). This is where all the routes of the VPN are being exchanged via  BGP. 

## About
Our Network is not full-meshed. Everbody has a VPN connection to one or more participants. The connections are bound to a local DynDNS/DNS address. In the VPN connection BGP is used for inter-AS-routing and by default OSPF for internal AS routing, but you may use another protocol for internal routing.

## Adresses
 * _172.22.0.0/15_
 * AS-Numbers: _>64600_

We handle IPv4-addresses, by giving away numbers in 2-steps, while everbody gets a _172.22.n.0/23_-network and an _64600+n_-AS-number. **Please enter in registry!**
